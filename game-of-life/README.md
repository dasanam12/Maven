# Game of Life

## Description

**Conway's Game of Life web version!**  
It is turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor.  
I hope this repository is a good lab for game of life.  
And I also hope this repository is a [good starting point](https://github.com/TroyTae/game-of-life/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) for first-time contributors.
